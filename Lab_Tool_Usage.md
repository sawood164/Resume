# Prompt Engineering: Professional Summary

---

## 1. Introduction to Prompt Engineering

- A **prompt** is the initial input (`x`) given to a large language model (LLM), guiding its output (`y = f(x)`).
- It acts as a **trigger** that shapes the LLM‚Äôs response based on the input provided.

---

## 2. LLM Mechanics: From Input to Output

- LLMs convert input sentences into **embedding vectors** and predict the next word based on a **probability distribution**.
- They generate responses **iteratively**, one word/token at a time, until a **stop word** is reached.
- LLMs contain **interpretable "concepts"** represented by **neural subcircuits** that influence their responses.

## 3. Building Effective Prompts for Agents

- Effective AI agents rely on **well-crafted prompts**, consisting of:
  - **System Prompt** ‚Äì Defines the agent's persona and behavior.
  - **User Prompt** ‚Äì The actual question or task input from the user.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Key Components of a System Prompt:
- **Role** ‚Äì Defines who the agent is (e.g., assistant, tutor, coder).
- **Background** ‚Äì Context or domain-specific knowledge.
- **Audience** ‚Äì Who the output is meant for.
- **Guardrails** ‚Äì Rules or boundaries for the agent.
- **Tone** ‚Äì Formal, casual, helpful, technical, etc.
- **Preferences** ‚Äì Stylistic or structural choices.
- **Output Format** ‚Äì JSON, bullet list, paragraph, code block, etc.

## 4. Effective Prompting Techniques

- **Few-shot Prompting**  
  Provide input-output examples within the prompt to demonstrate desired behavior.

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
  Encourage the model to **reason step-by-step** before answering.

- **Self-consistency**  
  Generate multiple reasoning paths and **synthesize** the best or most consistent answer.

- **Meta-prompting**  
  Writing prompts that **guide or generate** other prompts, enhancing control over output generation.

## 5. AI Agents and Prompting

- **Context** is crucial because **bare LLMs lack inherent memory** of prior interactions.
- **Agentic frameworks** extend capabilities by managing:
  - **Long-term memory**
  - **User-specific context**
  - **Goal-directed behavior**
