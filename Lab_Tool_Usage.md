 Final Session on AI-Driven Software Engineering & Cursor Rules

## 🎯 Session Focus (00:01)
The session advances the learning hierarchy by transitioning from basic prompt-following to creating and refining custom cursor rules, applying Bloom’s Taxonomy to reach higher-order skills like evaluation, synthesis, and creation.

---

## 🧠 Core Activities & Format (00:41)
- ✅ **Cursor Rule Presentations** – Teams demonstrated the rules they created and received peer/instructor feedback.
- ✅ **Debate & Evaluation** – Rules were discussed and challenged to improve clarity and impact.
- ✅ **Mini Project Demos** – Small, functional projects were presented that followed the newly crafted cursor standards.
- 🎁 **Bonus Reveal** – Unlocked based on the quality of rule submissions and project demos.

- Emphasis on pinning exact dependency versions to avoid breaking changes.
- Use of **UV** and the **UV lock file** to ensure reproducibility across machines.

### 2. Code Style & Security Best Practices

- Focus on object-oriented principles, accessibility audits, and avoiding hardcoded secrets or global mutations.
- Strong reminder to always provide alt text for images.

### 3. Refining Rules with AI

- Best practices include:
  - Keeping rules modular and in small files.
  - Using quantifiable metrics (e.g., code complexity thresholds, type hint coverage) for clarity and enforceability.

### 5. Architecture Principles

- **Always > Manual > Ask**: Choose where and when rules apply thoughtfully.
- Effective rules require:
  - Deep reflection  
  - Iterative improvement  
  - Modular design  
  - Quantitative clarity

## 🔐 Final Lecture: How Not to Fail at AI Projects (01:20:00+)

### 1. "Failure is Not an Option" Mentality  
📍 *Screenshot at 01:22:08*![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f576373-4804-45a7-aae0-4b198dd00aaa)

- Inspired by NASA's *Seven Minutes of Terror*, this mindset builds resilient, production-grade software.

### 2. The Survival Curve of AI Projects  
📍 *Screenshot at 01:23:44*![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5bcfd3c-c55a-4b2f-9d50-664c2300874f)

- Only ~5% of AI initiatives reach maturity. Persistence, scholarship, and design rigor are key differentiators.

### 3. Principles for Successful Projects

- ❓ **Quo Vadis?** *(Where are we going?)* – Keep AI aligned to business outcomes.  
- 🐢 **Festina Lente** *(Make haste slowly)* – Move fast but without cutting corners.📍 *Screenshot at *(01:29:58)*![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97c4334c-1797-443e-a983-891e4dee4f9a)
 
- 📊 **Tyranny of Data** – Data labeling and curation is 80% of AI effort.  
- 🧪 **No Free Lunch Theorem** – Don’t assume one approach will work. Test all.  
- 🧭 **Explore like Terra Incognita** – Approach every project as an unknown land.  
- 🌍 **Collective Intelligence Wins** – Diverse, experimental teams outperform top-down decision making.  
- 📈 **Measure What Matters** – Continuously track latency, code quality, and performance.
