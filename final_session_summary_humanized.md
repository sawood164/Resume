 Final Session on AI-Driven Software Engineering & Cursor Rules

## 🎯 Session Focus (00:01)
The session advances the learning hierarchy by transitioning from basic prompt-following to creating and refining custom cursor rules, applying Bloom’s Taxonomy to reach higher-order skills like evaluation, synthesis, and creation.

---

## 🧠 Core Activities & Format (00:41)
- ✅ **Cursor rule sharing** – Teams demonstrated the rules they created and received peer/instructor feedback.
- ✅ **Debate & Evaluation** – Rules were discussed and challenged to improve clarity and impact.
- ✅ **Mini Project Demos** – Small, functional projects were presented that followed the newly crafted cursor standards.
- 🎁 **Bonus Reveal** – Unlocked based on the quality of rule submissions and project demos.

## 📜 Deep Dive: Highlights from the team’s cursor rules

### 1. Dependency Management  
📍 *Screenshot at 02:34 – 04:34*![Screenshot](screenshots/01.png)

- Emphasis on pinning exact dependency versions to avoid breaking changes.
- Use of **UV** and the **UV lock file** to ensure reproducibility across machines.

### 2. Code Style & Security Best Practices

- Focus on object-oriented principles, accessibility audits, and avoiding hardcoded secrets or global mutations.
- Strong reminder to always provide alt text for images.

### 3. Refining Rules with AI  
📍 *Screenshot at 09:07 – 15:13*![Screenshot](screenshots/03.png)

- Demonstrated how to use ChatGPT to refine cursor rules using precise, declarative language.
- Encouraged iterative reformulation to align the agent with developer expectations.

### 4. Modularity & Metrics  
📍 *Screenshot at 20:25 – 23:04*![Screenshot](screenshots/04.png)

- Best practices include:
  - Keeping rules modular and in small files.
  - Using quantifiable metrics (e.g., code complexity thresholds, type hint coverage) for clarity and enforceability.

### 5. Architecture Principles

## 🚀 Showcase: Loan Management System (27:37)![Screenshot](screenshots/06.png)


Snail presented a complete loan management system developed via Cursor.

- **Using Cursor helped cut dev time from months to 2.5 hours.**
- Features included:
  - FICO-based credit decisions
  - Form validation
  - rules that Cursor helped apply

## 🧩 Understanding MCP & AI Agent Integration 

- Introduction to **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, a framework for exposing domain tools to AI agents.
- Importance of agents being able to **observe, reason, and act** across tools like GitHub, vulnerability scanners, etc.

- **Always > Manual > Ask**: Choose where and when rules apply thoughtfully.
- Effective rules require:
  - Deep reflection  
  - Iterative improvement  
  - Modular design  
  - Quantitative clarity

## 🔐 Closing Thoughts: How Not to Fail at AI Projects (01:20:00+)

### 1. "Failure is Not an Option" Mentality  
📍 *Screenshot at 01:22:08*![Screenshot](screenshots/08.png)

- Inspired by NASA's *Seven Minutes of Terror*, this mindset builds resilient, production-grade software.

### 2. The Survival Curve of AI Projects  
📍 *Screenshot at 01:23:44*![Screenshot](screenshots/09.png)

- Only ~5% of AI initiatives reach maturity. Persistence, scholarship, and design rigor are key differentiators.

### 3. Principles for Successful Projects

- ❓ **Quo Vadis?** *(Where are we going?)* – Keep AI aligned to business outcomes.  
- 🐢 **Festina Lente** *(Make haste slowly)* – Move fast but without cutting corners.📍 *Screenshot at *(01:29:58)*![Screenshot](screenshots/10.png)
 
- 📊 **Tyranny of Data** – Data labeling and curation is 80% of AI effort.  
- 🧪 **No Free Lunch Theorem** – Don’t assume one approach will work. Test all.  
- 🧭 **Explore like Terra Incognita** – Approach every project as an unknown land.  
- 🌍 **Collective Intelligence Wins** – Diverse, experimental teams outperform top-down decision making.  
- 📈 **Measure What Matters** – Continuously track latency, code quality, and performance.
